 *DONE* Update chisel.py as is to create the blog.example.com site you want
	chisel.py
	posts/
	site/
	templates/
   Once that is all checked into git, then it should be easy to see that
   changes to chisel.py do not break site generation.

  *DONE* Move configuration information into a seperate file (INI)
	import ConfigPartser
	confg = ConfigParer.ConfigParser()
	config.read("example.com.ini")
  The above code gets the config file into the config object.
	config.sections() # shows sections
	config.items("GENERAL") shows items in the GENERAL section
	for x,y in config.items("TEMPLATES"):
		templates[x] = y
  The above code will create the templates dictionary.

 * Work on templates and get blog going

 * Need to add a list to chisel.py of expected variables that are defined in INI
   {BASEURL, SOURCE, DESTINATION, HOME_SHOW, TEMPLATE_PATH, TEMPLATE_OPTIONS, TIME_FORMAT, ENTRY_TIME_FORMAT, URLEXT, PATHEXT, title, description, description_rss, title_rss}

 * Need to test changes as you make them to chisel.py

 * Rename this if you end up changing it a lot: Burin see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burin

 * What is the correct way to let python know the encoding of the script?

 * nice to have: script could genreate its own config file example
